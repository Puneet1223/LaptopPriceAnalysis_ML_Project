## **About**
This project predicts the price of a laptop based on features like **brand, type, RAM, storage, screen size, CPU, GPU**, and more. It uses a **scikit-learn pipeline** to preprocess the data and make predictions, wrapped in a **Flask web application** for easy interaction.

---

## **Features**
- Predict laptop price from user input.
- User-friendly **HTML form** for input.
- Preprocessing with **OneHotEncoding** for categorical features and scaling for numerical features.
- Uses a trained **Random Forest / Decision Tree model** (pipeline saved with `pickle`).

---

## **Dataset**
The dataset includes features like:
- `Company`, `TypeName`, `Inches`, `Ram`, `OS`, `Weight`, `Touchscreen`, `IPSpanel`, `GPU_company`, `PPI`, `Cpu_Brand`, `SSD`, `HDD`, `Price`.
